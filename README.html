                            <p>『Discouraged Workers』 is a satirical story based on the popular Korean soap operas-styled plot. It compares Ga-Yeon’s bleak everyday life to the dark side of youth.</p>
                            <blockquote class="text-warning"><p>As a hospital coordinator, Ga-Yeon fell in love with a doctor at the hospital she was working in and they had an affair even though the doctor was a married man. When the director found out, she was fired. For over a year she tried to find another job, but her mental uneasiness eventually made her give up and she became a recluse.</p>
                            <p>A year later, in the spring of 2013, her younger sister, Hye-Na, and her first love Yun-Woo come to her.</p>
                            <p>A story about the dark side of today’s youth and serious life events happening around Ga-Yeon.</p>
