Hello!

Welcome to the TIGRS(tm) family! If you want to use the free TIGRS
service for your gaming product, you've come to the right place!

If you are self-publishing and need large, print accessible graphics,
you are using the right package. If you need your rating on your website,
it is best you use the TIGRS generator to create all the HTML code
necessary for proper integration into your site. You can find the TIGRS
generator at the following URL:

GETTING STARTED
======================================================================

You can find all the graphics you need for large, print accessible
TIGRS ratings in this archive. For your convenience, several different
styles have been rendered, depending on your needs. The file structure
is self-explanatory, so just browse the files until you find one you
need!

In addition to the default TIGRS rating icons, you can extend them to
include TIGRS approved content descriptors. For a list of descriptors,
please visit the following URL:

http://www.tigrs.org/?page=ratings

Additionally, for a list of the specifications you must follow, visit:

http://www.tigrs.org/?page=specs

Finally, using a graphics editing and layout program (such as Adobe
Photoshop or Corel Paint Shop Pro, trademarks of their respective
owners) composite the appropriate descriptor box
(tigrs-descriptor-box-horizontal.png or tigrs-descriptor-box-vertical.png)
behind your selected TIGRS rating. You may have to crop the descriptor
box to comfortably fit all descriptors. You must use the text settings
present on either descriptor box image. (Black, bold, Arial and of that
size.)

If there is any question regarding what the box is supposed to look like,
please pre-generate a box on the TIGRS website and use it as a reference:
