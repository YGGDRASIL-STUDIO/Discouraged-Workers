Discouraged Workers
===================
『Discouraged Workers』 is an indie adventure kinetic novel produced by YGGDRASIL STUDIO. The game is the fifth in the Project DW series.


Overview
===================
『Discouraged Workers』 is a satirical story based on the popular Korean soap operas-styled plot. It compares Ga-Yeon’s bleak everyday life to the dark side of youth.

> _A hospital coordinator, Ga-Yeon, fell in love with a doctor at the hospital she was working in and they had an affair even though the doctor was a married man. But when the director found out, she was fired. For over a year she tried to find another job, but her mental uneasiness eventually made her give up and she became a recluse._

> _A year later, in the spring of 2013, her younger sister, Hye-Na, and her first love Yun-Woo come to her._

> _A story about the dark side of today’s youth and pretty serious everyday life happening around Ga-Yeon._
